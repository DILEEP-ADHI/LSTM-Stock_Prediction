This folder contains the main program for 'Stock Prediction using LSTM' and its dataset 'MicrosoftStock.csv'.
In the main.py I have used 2 types of models for comparison. First I used a baseline model 'SARIMAX' model and used metrics to calculate error.
Then I used 'LSTM' model and took metrics for that too and compared both of them, you can check those using the plots which shows the differences between them.
To scale the dataset I used Standard Scaler.
